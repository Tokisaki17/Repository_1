# Repository_1
This repository composes my project of a budget tracker with an interaction themed anime character Hatsune Miku.
This is my first project and first time to use this. So I might have a little inconsistencies with this.


The zip files contains several modules (accountManagement, BudgAlloc, Expenditure, and Report) with the machine_problem_project as its main.

Inside the main, you'll see the vs solution, folders, etc. To get to the bin, first click the folder machine_problem_project_new -> bin -> debug -> machine_problem_project_new.exe (the app a console app) popping up a windows forms.

This is my first project
